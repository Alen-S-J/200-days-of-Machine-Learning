
# Named Entity Recognition with Transformer Model

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using a transformer model. The model is implemented using a deep learning framework and fine-tuned on a selected NLP task.

## Introduction

Named Entity Recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying and classifying entities such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc., in a given text. This project focuses on implementing a transformer-based model to perform NER on a specific task.



## Data

Describe the dataset used for training and evaluation. Include information about the format of the data, any preprocessing steps, and where to obtain the dataset.

## Model Architecture

Explain the architecture of the transformer model used for NER. Include details about the number of layers, attention mechanisms, and any other relevant components.

## Training

Provide instructions on how to train the model using the prepared dataset. Include hyperparameters, training duration, and any additional considerations.

```bash
python train.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

## Evaluation

Explain how to evaluate the model on the test set. Include metrics used for evaluation and expected performance.



## Results

Present the results of the NER model, including metrics, accuracy, and any visualizations that help interpret the performance.

## Usage

Demonstrate how to use the trained model for NER on new text data.

```python
from ner_transformer import NERModel

model = NERModel.load_model("path/to/saved_model")
text = "Example text for NER."
entities = model.predict_entities(text)
print(entities)
```
