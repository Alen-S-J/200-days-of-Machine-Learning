## Introduction

Computer vision tasks such as image segmentation and object detection play a crucial role in various fields, including medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance systems. This project provides implementations of U-Net for image segmentation and Faster R-CNN for object detection, using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the following dependencies:

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Image Segmentation with U-Net

1. Ensure that your dataset is prepared and organized. 
2. Modify the U-Net implementation (`unet.py`) to suit your specific requirements if necessary.
3. Run the U-Net training script (`train_unet.py`) to train the model on your dataset.
4. Evaluate the trained model using the provided evaluation script (`evaluate_unet.py`).

### Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

1. Prepare your dataset following the required format for object detection tasks.
2. Customize the Faster R-CNN implementation (`faster_rcnn.py`) based on your dataset and requirements.
3. Fine-tune the pre-trained model on your dataset by running the training script (`train_faster_rcnn.py`).
4. Evaluate the trained model on your validation or test set using the evaluation script (`evaluate_faster_rcnn.py`).

## Models

- **U-Net**: A convolutional neural network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. It consists of a contracting path (encoder) followed by an expansive path (decoder) to produce pixel-wise segmentation masks.
- **Faster R-CNN**: A state-of-the-art object detection model that combines region proposal networks (RPNs) with a fast R-CNN detector. It provides accurate object localization and classification by efficiently generating region proposals and refining them using a CNN.
