# Fine-Tuning Model 

## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to the fine-tuning process, its objectives, and why it's essential.

## Model Information

Outline the base model you used and the dataset it was pre-trained on. Include details like:

- Base model: [Model Name]
- Pre-training dataset: [Dataset Name]
- Fine-tuning dataset: [Your Dataset Name]

## Fine-Tuning Process

Describe the steps taken during fine-tuning:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explain any specific preprocessing steps applied to the data.
2. **Model Configuration**: Detail any modifications made to the model architecture or hyperparameters.
3. **Training**: Specify the training duration, batch size, learning rate, and any other relevant training parameters.

## Evaluation and Analysis

Compare the fine-tuned model's performance with baseline models:

- **Metrics Used**: List the evaluation metrics used (accuracy, F1 score, etc.).
- **Comparison**: Provide a comparative analysis between the fine-tuned model and baseline models.
- **Interpretation**: Explain the impact of fine-tuning strategies on performance improvements or limitations.

## Troubleshooting

Address common issues faced during fine-tuning and solutions:

- **Overfitting/Underfitting**: How did you detect and address these issues?
- **Data Imbalance**: Steps taken to handle imbalanced datasets.
- **Resource Constraints**: Strategies for dealing with limited computational resources.

## Documentation and Summary

Summarize your understanding of fine-tuning techniques:

- **Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Recap different fine-tuning methods employed.
- **Practical Applications**: Discuss scenarios where fine-tuning is beneficial and potential limitations.
