### Day 51: Foundations of RNNs

- **Academic Papers and Articles on RNN Basics**
  - Look for seminal papers on RNNs like the original paper by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams or more recent ones that introduce improvements or variations.
  - Focus on understanding the fundamental architecture of RNNs, how they process sequential data, and their ability to retain memory over time steps.
  - Pay attention to concepts like hidden states, recurrent connections, and the unfolding of the network through time.

- **Video Tutorials and Lectures on RNN Concepts**
  - Explore online platforms like Coursera, YouTube (lectures from academic institutions), or dedicated machine learning websites offering tutorials on RNNs.
  - Watch videos explaining the concepts in a visual manner, emphasizing applications in natural language processing (NLP), time series analysis, and other sequential data domains.
  - Take notes to reinforce your understanding of how RNNs handle sequences and their applications in different fields.

- **Review Code Examples Implementing Simple RNNs**
  - Search for code repositories or tutorials on platforms like GitHub, Kaggle, or machine learning blogs that demonstrate basic RNN implementations.
  - Study code snippets that involve sequence prediction or generation tasks using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras.
  - Experiment with small modifications to understand how altering parameters affects the model's behavior and predictions.
