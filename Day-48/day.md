### Day 48: Data Augmentation Techniques

#### Goal:
Improve the robustness and generalization of the dataset by applying various augmentation techniques.

#### Plan:
1. **Research Augmentation Methods:**
    - **Rotation:** Implement code to rotate images by certain degrees (e.g., 15, 30 degrees) using libraries like OpenCV or PIL.
    - **Flipping:** Explore horizontal and vertical flipping techniques to increase variability in the dataset.
    - **Zooming:** Experiment with zooming in/out on images to simulate different scales.

2. **Implementation:**
    - Choose a subset of the dataset to apply augmentation initially for testing purposes.
    - Write functions/classes to apply rotation, flipping, and zooming on images.
    - Validate the augmented images to ensure they retain quality and relevance.

3. **Augmentation Integration:**
    - Integrate augmentation techniques into the data pipeline before feeding it to the CNN model.
    - Ensure a balance between augmentation and original data to maintain the dataset's natural distribution.

4. **Model Training:**
    - Train the CNN model using both augmented and original datasets.
    - Monitor the model's performance metrics (accuracy, loss) on validation sets after each epoch.

5. **Evaluation and Comparison:**
    - Compare the model's performance with and without augmentation.
    - Assess how augmentation affects generalization and model robustness.

6. **Documentation and Reflection:**
    - Document the augmentation techniques applied and their impact on the dataset and model performance.
    - Reflect on observations and insights gained through this augmentation process.

#### Resources:
- Online tutorials or documentation on data augmentation techniques in Python libraries like OpenCV, PIL, or TensorFlow.
- Papers or articles discussing the impact of augmentation on model generalization.
- GitHub repositories or sample code illustrating augmentation implementation with CNNs.


### sample data augmentation techniques(pil library)

```Python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

# Define the directory containing your images
data_dir = 'path/to/your/dataset/'

# Function for rotating images
def rotate_image(image_path, degrees):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    rotated_img = img.rotate(degrees)
    return rotated_img

# Function for flipping images horizontally and vertically
def flip_image(image_path, flip_type):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    if flip_type == 'horizontal':
        flipped_img = img.transpose(Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT)
    elif flip_type == 'vertical':
        flipped_img = img.transpose(Image.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM)
    else:
        flipped_img = img
    return flipped_img

# Function for zooming images
def zoom_image(image_path, zoom_factor):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    width, height = img.size
    new_width = int(width * zoom_factor)
    new_height = int(height * zoom_factor)
    zoomed_img = img.resize((new_width, new_height))
    return zoomed_img

# Test the augmentation functions on a sample image
sample_image_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'sample_image.jpg')

# Rotate the image by 30 degrees
rotated_image = rotate_image(sample_image_path, 30)
rotated_image.show()

# Flip the image horizontally
flipped_horizontal_image = flip_image(sample_image_path, 'horizontal')
flipped_horizontal_image.show()

# Flip the image vertically
flipped_vertical_image = flip_image(sample_image_path, 'vertical')
flipped_vertical_image.show()

# Zoom the image by a factor of 1.5
zoomed_image = zoom_image(sample_image_path, 1.5)
zoomed_image.show()
