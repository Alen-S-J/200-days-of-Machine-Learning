### Day 48: Data Augmentation Techniques

#### Goal:
Improve the robustness and generalization of the dataset by applying various augmentation techniques.

#### Plan:
1. **Research Augmentation Methods:**
    - **Rotation:** Implement code to rotate images by certain degrees (e.g., 15, 30 degrees) using libraries like OpenCV or PIL.
    - **Flipping:** Explore horizontal and vertical flipping techniques to increase variability in the dataset.
    - **Zooming:** Experiment with zooming in/out on images to simulate different scales.

2. **Implementation:**
    - Choose a subset of the dataset to apply augmentation initially for testing purposes.
    - Write functions/classes to apply rotation, flipping, and zooming on images.
    - Validate the augmented images to ensure they retain quality and relevance.

3. **Augmentation Integration:**
    - Integrate augmentation techniques into the data pipeline before feeding it to the CNN model.
    - Ensure a balance between augmentation and original data to maintain the dataset's natural distribution.

4. **Model Training:**
    - Train the CNN model using both augmented and original datasets.
    - Monitor the model's performance metrics (accuracy, loss) on validation sets after each epoch.

5. **Evaluation and Comparison:**
    - Compare the model's performance with and without augmentation.
    - Assess how augmentation affects generalization and model robustness.

6. **Documentation and Reflection:**
    - Document the augmentation techniques applied and their impact on the dataset and model performance.
    - Reflect on observations and insights gained through this augmentation process.

#### Resources:
- Online tutorials or documentation on data augmentation techniques in Python libraries like OpenCV, PIL, or TensorFlow.
- Papers or articles discussing the impact of augmentation on model generalization.
- GitHub repositories or sample code illustrating augmentation implementation with CNNs.
