## Introduction
Explain the fundamental concept of domain adaptation in transfer learning. Discuss scenarios where source and target domains might differ, causing performance discrepancies in machine learning models.

## Techniques

### Adversarial Training
Explain how adversarial training works in domain adaptation. Discuss the idea of aligning feature distributions between domains using a domain discriminator.

### Discrepancy-Based Methods
Discuss techniques that aim to minimize distribution differences between domains by measuring statistical disparities.

### Instance Re-weighting
Detail the approach of assigning different weights to instances from source and target domains during training to adapt to target data.

## Practical Implementation


### TensorFlow Implementation Example
Offer another code example using TensorFlow for domain adaptation. Include explanations and highlight the similarities/differences between the PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations.
