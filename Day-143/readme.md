# Day 143: Practical Implementation of Object Detection

- **Morning Session**:
    - Review the results from yesterday's training and evaluation.
    - Analyze any shortcomings or areas for improvement in the model's performance.
    - Consider techniques for addressing any identified issues, such as adjusting model architecture, data augmentation, or optimizing hyperparameters.
    - Implement any necessary changes or optimizations to the model or training process.

- **Afternoon Session**:
    - Conduct additional training with the updated model to incorporate improvements.
    - Monitor the training process and adjust as needed.
    - Once training is complete, evaluate the updated model's performance using the same metrics as before.
    - Compare the results with the previous iteration of the model to assess improvements.
    - Document your findings, including any changes made and their impact on performance, for future reference and reporting.
