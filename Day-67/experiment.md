### Experiment 1: Mode Collapse

#### Real-world Problem: Insufficient Data Variability
1. **Problem Identification**: Identify areas of limited variability in your dataset causing mode collapse.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques specific to your domain (e.g., rotation, scaling, cropping, color jittering).
3. **Evaluation**: Train the GAN with and without augmented data. Assess whether the augmented dataset helps in generating more diverse and realistic samples.

### Experiment 2: Instability

#### Real-world Problem: Oscillations in Training
1. **Problem Identification**: Identify instances of oscillations or erratic behavior during GAN training.
2. **Architecture Modification**: Experiment with different network architectures or regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, batch normalization) to stabilize training.
3. **Evaluation**: Observe convergence patterns, generator/discriminator losses, and sample quality. Determine if architectural changes reduce oscillations and improve stability.

### Experiment 3: Vanishing Gradients

#### Real-world Problem: Training Stagnation
1. **Problem Identification**: Recognize when gradients vanish, hindering effective learning.
2. **Activation and Initialization**: Implement LeakyReLU activation and try different weight initialization methods.
3. **Evaluation**: Monitor gradient flow, convergence speed, and sample quality. Determine if the chosen activation and initialization methods alleviate stagnation.

### Experiment Evaluation:

- **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Utilize domain-specific metrics if available (e.g., for medical images, use medical expert evaluations).
- **Real-world Use Cases**: Evaluate the generated samples in the context of the intended application to assess their practical utility.
- **Computational Resources**: Consider the computational cost and feasibility of implementing different strategies in a real-world scenario.

These experiments are aimed at resolving GAN training issues rooted in real-world problems, enabling you to iteratively improve your model's performance and applicability within your specific domain. Evaluating these experiments based on practical utility and domain-specific metrics is crucial for real-world applications.
