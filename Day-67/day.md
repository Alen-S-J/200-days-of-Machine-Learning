#  Troubleshooting and Debugging
### Mode Collapse:

#### Adding Noise to Inputs:
Mathematically, adding noise to the input data can be represented as follows:
Let \( x \) be the original input data, \( \epsilon \) be the noise vector sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation \( \sigma \).

The modified input data with added noise can be expressed as: 
\[ \tilde{x} = x + \epsilon \]

### Instability:

#### Feature Matching:
The feature matching loss encourages the generator to match the features of real data distribution. Let \( \phi_D(x) \) denote the intermediate layer representation (features) extracted by the discriminator for real data \( x \), and \( \phi_D(G(z)) \) represent the features for generated data \( G(z) \), where \( z \) is the latent vector.

The feature matching loss is given by:
\[ L_{\text{FM}} = \| \mathbb{E}[\phi_D(x)] - \mathbb{E}[\phi_D(G(z))]\| \]

This loss aims to minimize the discrepancy between the expected intermediate features of real and generated data.

### Vanishing Gradients:

#### LeakyReLU Activation:
Mathematically, the LeakyReLU activation function introduces a slight slope for negative inputs, preventing complete saturation and encouraging non-zero gradients for negative values. It is represented as:
\[ \text{LeakyReLU}(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x > 0 \\ \alpha x & \text{if } x \leq 0 \end{cases} \]
where \( \alpha \) is a small positive constant representing the slope for negative inputs.

#### Weight Initialization:
Weight initialization, such as He initialization or Xavier initialization, influences the distribution of initial weights in the network. For instance, in He initialization for a ReLU-based network, weights are initialized from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance \( \frac{2}{\text{input_size}} \).

These mathematical representations elucidate how noise addition, feature matching, LeakyReLU activations, and weight initialization are incorporated within GANs to tackle mode collapse, instability, and vanishing gradients, enriching the learning process and network training dynamics.
