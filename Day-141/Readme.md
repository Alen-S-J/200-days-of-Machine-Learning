# **Day 141 Plan:**

### - **Summarize Learnings from Days 138-140:**
- Reflect on the progress made in selecting a project, defining goals, and outlining a technical roadmap.
- Consider any challenges encountered during data gathering, preprocessing, and model selection.
- Note any insights gained from refining the project plan based on data exploration and community feedback.

- **Review Project Goals and Technical Roadmap:**
    - Ensure clarity and feasibility of project goals.
    - Revisit the technical roadmap and make adjustments if necessary based on recent learnings.
    - Confirm alignment between project goals and chosen methodologies.

- **Continue Gathering Necessary Data:**
    - Identify any additional datasets required for the project.
    - Search for reputable sources or repositories to access relevant data.
    - Consider data quality, relevance, and ethical considerations during the selection process.

- **Data Preprocessing and Exploration:**
    - Begin preprocessing the gathered data to prepare it for analysis and modeling.
    - Cleanse the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the data.
    - Utilize visualization techniques to gain insights and identify potential features for modeling.

- **Refine Project Plan:**
    - Incorporate insights from data preprocessing and exploration into the project plan.
    - Adjust timelines, milestones, and resource allocation as needed.
    - Ensure that the project plan remains realistic and achievable based on available resources and constraints.

- **Engage with Online Communities:**
    - Share your project idea and progress updates with relevant online communities or forums.
    - Seek feedback, suggestions, and insights from peers and experts in the field.
    - Participate in discussions, answer questions, and contribute to the community to build connections and gain valuable perspectives.
