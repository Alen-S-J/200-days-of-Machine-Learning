# Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model for product reviews. The goal is to automatically classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of reviews, helping businesses understand customer feedback and sentiments towards their products.

## Scope and Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification.
2. Research and experiment with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., RNNs, Transformers) for sentiment analysis.
3. Use publicly available datasets (e.g., Amazon Product Reviews, Yelp Reviews, Twitter Sentiment140) for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
4. Deploy the trained model as an API or web service for real-time sentiment classification of product reviews.
5. Create a user-friendly interface or dashboard for businesses to analyze customer sentiment.
