# Challenges and Considerations in Transfer Learning

## Overview
This section explores the key challenges encountered in transfer learning and considerations essential for successful implementation.

### Domain Gap
Transfer learning often encounters domain gaps between the source and target domains. Addressing this challenge requires careful consideration of model selection and fine-tuning techniques to adapt the pre-trained model to the new domain's characteristics.

### Dataset Size
Limited or insufficient data in the target domain can hinder effective transfer learning. Strategies like data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, or zero-shot learning can mitigate the impact of small datasets.

### Model Selection
Choosing an appropriate pre-trained model for transfer learning involves assessing the similarity between the source and target tasks, available computational resources, and the availability of labeled data for fine-tuning.
