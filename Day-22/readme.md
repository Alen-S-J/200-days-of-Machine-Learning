# **Day 22: K-means Clustering**

- ### **Dive into K-means, one of the most popular clustering algorithms**.
- ### **Learn the mathematical principles behind K-means, including the objective function (sum of squared    distances) and the algorithm's steps.**
- ### **Implement K-means from scratch in a programming language of your choice.**
- ### **Apply K-means to a simple dataset to see how it groups data into clusters.**
