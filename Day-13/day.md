### **Day 13: Understanding k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

- **Morning**:
    - **Introduction to k-Nearest Neighbors**:
        - Understand the basic concept of the KNN algorithm.
        - Learn about distance metrics and how they impact KNN.
- **Afternoon**:
    - **Mathematical Foundation**:
        - Understand the mathematical basis of KNN, including distance metrics like Euclidean distance.
- **Evening**:
    - **Implementation**:
        - Implement the KNN algorithm either from scratch or using a library.
        - Apply KNN to a dataset, experiment with different values of k, and visualize the results.
