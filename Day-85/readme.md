## Introduction

Fine-tuning leverages pre-trained models to adapt them to specific tasks, domains, or datasets, significantly reducing training time and resource requirements. Advanced fine-tuning techniques aim to optimize this process further, allowing for improved model performance, faster convergence, and better generalization.

## Fine-Tuning Techniques

### Gradual Unfreezing

Gradual unfreezing involves selectively unfreezing layers of a pre-trained model during fine-tuning. By starting with unfreezing only the top layers and gradually moving to lower layers, the model can adapt to task-specific features while retaining valuable information learned during pre-training.

### Differential Learning Rates

Differential learning rates assign different learning rates to different layers during fine-tuning. This technique enables faster convergence by allowing certain layers to adapt more quickly while stabilizing the learning process in others, enhancing the model's ability to specialize in various features.

### Layer Freezing

Layer freezing involves keeping certain layers of a pre-trained model fixed during fine-tuning while allowing other layers to be updated. This strategy is beneficial when dealing with limited annotated data or when specific layers are already well-suited for the target task.
