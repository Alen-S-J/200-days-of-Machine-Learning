# Day 123: Weather Time Series Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to Day 123 of the 200 Days of ML challenge! Today, we will dive into the fascinating world of time series analysis using a weather dataset provided by the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. This dataset encompasses 14 different features, including air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, recorded at 10-minute intervals starting from 2003. To streamline our analysis, we will focus on the data collected between 2009 and 2016, as curated by François Chollet for his book "Deep Learning with Python."

## Dataset Information

- **Source:** Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry
- **Features:**
  1. Air Temperature
  2. Atmospheric Pressure
  3. Humidity
  4. ... (11 more features)
- **Collection Interval:** 10 minutes
- **Data Range:** 2003 to 2016 (For our analysis, we'll focus on the years 2009-2016)

## Steps to Reproduce

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Access the dataset from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry or François Chollet's book resources.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and any additional libraries required for deep learning.

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Load and Preprocess Data:**
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it to include only the relevant years (2009-2016).

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and gain insights into the weather data.

5. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Utilize time series analysis techniques to uncover trends, seasonality, and any notable patterns within the data.

6. **Optional: Deep Learning Modeling:**
   - If interested, explore deep learning models for time series forecasting using tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

7. **Create a Readme File:**
   - Document your process, findings, and any code snippets in a readme file for future reference.

## Conclusion

Day 123 was dedicated to exploring the Max Planck weather dataset, focusing on the years 2009-2016. By conducting time series analysis, we gained valuable insights into the weather patterns recorded at 10-minute intervals. Whether you're interested in traditional time series techniques or eager to delve into deep learning applications, this tutorial provides a solid foundation for further exploration.
