**Understanding Outliers:**
- Begin by defining outliers and their significance in time series analysis.
- Discuss the various types of outliers, including global outliers (affecting the entire dataset) and local outliers (affecting specific subsets of data).
- Explore methods for detecting outliers, such as statistical techniques (z-score, Tukey's method) and machine learning approaches (clustering-based outlier detection, isolation forests, etc.).

**Handling Outliers:**
- Delve into strategies for handling outliers in time series data, emphasizing the importance of understanding their underlying causes.
- Discuss techniques for outlier treatment, including transformation methods (log transformation, winsorization) and outlier removal methods (trimming, robust regression, etc.).
- Highlight the potential risks and trade-offs associated with outlier handling, such as loss of information versus improved model performance.

**Dealing with Non-Stationarity:**
- Define non-stationarity and its implications for time series analysis, emphasizing its effects on statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation.
- Discuss common causes of non-stationarity, such as trends, seasonality, and structural breaks.
- Explore techniques for addressing non-stationarity, including detrending methods (moving averages, polynomial regression) and deseasonalization techniques (seasonal decomposition, seasonal adjustment).
- Illustrate the application of these techniques using real-world examples to demonstrate their effectiveness in stabilizing time series data for analysis and modeling.
