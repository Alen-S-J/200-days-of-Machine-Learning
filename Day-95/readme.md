# Semi-Supervised Learning using PyTorch on CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Introduction
This repository contains code for a semi-supervised learning experiment using PyTorch. The goal is to implement SSL techniques on the CIFAR-10 dataset, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve classification accuracy.


## Project Overview
- **SSL Techniques**: Implementing SSL techniques like pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, or self-training.
- **Dataset**: Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **Model**: A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture implemented in PyTorch.
- **Training**: Utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data for model training.

### Prerequisites
