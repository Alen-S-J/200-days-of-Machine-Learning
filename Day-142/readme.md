- **Morning Session**:
  - **9:00 AM - 9:30 AM**: Set up the development environment:
    - Install the necessary deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch) and their dependencies.
    - Configure the environment for GPU support if available, as it can significantly speed up training.
  - **9:30 AM - 10:30 AM**: Gather datasets for object detection:
    - Identify suitable datasets for your object detection task. Consider popular datasets like COCO, Pascal VOC, or custom datasets relevant to your application.
    - Download the dataset(s) and organize them into appropriate directories.
  - **10:30 AM - 11:30 AM**: Preprocess the data:
    - Perform data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and resizing to increase the diversity of your dataset.
    - Label the objects in your images using annotation tools, ensuring each object is correctly annotated with its corresponding class label and bounding box coordinates.

- **Afternoon Session**:
  - **1:00 PM - 2:30 PM**: Implement YOLO using TensorFlow or PyTorch:
    - Choose the framework you're most comfortable with or interested in learning.
    - Set up the YOLO architecture according to the framework's guidelines, including configuring network layers, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
  - **2:30 PM - 4:00 PM**: Train the YOLO model:
    - Initialize the model with pre-trained weights (if available) or from scratch.
    - Train the model on your prepared dataset, monitoring the loss and performance metrics during training.
    - Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and anchor box sizes to optimize model performance.
  - **4:00 PM - 5:00 PM**: Evaluate model performance:
    - Use evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and mAP to assess the object detection model's performance.
    - Analyze any shortcomings or areas for improvement in the model's predictions.
    - Save the trained model and relevant evaluation results for future reference and comparison.
