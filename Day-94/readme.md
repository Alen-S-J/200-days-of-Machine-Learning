# Semi-Supervised Learning Dataset Selection

## Overview

Selecting an appropriate dataset is a critical step in SSL research. This README aims to guide the selection process by highlighting considerations and suggesting datasets commonly used for SSL tasks.

## Dataset Selection Considerations

### Problem Space
- Define the problem space you aim to address with SSL techniques.
- Consider datasets relevant to your specific problem domain or task.

### Available Datasets
- Explore existing datasets suitable for SSL, considering their sizes, features, and available labels.
- Common SSL datasets include:
    - MNIST: Handwritten digit classification.
    - CIFAR-10/100: Object classification in small images.
    - SVHN: House number recognition in real-world images.
    - ImageNet: Large-scale dataset for object recognition.

### Complexity
- Assess the complexities within the dataset, such as limited labeled data or diverse unlabeled data.
- Evaluate if the dataset characteristics align with the SSL techniques you plan to explore.

## Dataset Selection Process

### Research
- Conduct thorough research to identify datasets aligned with your problem space and SSL goals.
- Consider papers, articles, or repositories discussing datasets used in SSL research.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Define criteria (size, diversity, labeling quality) to evaluate datasets.
- Prioritize datasets that match your SSL goals and research requirements.

### Selection
- After evaluation, choose a dataset that best suits your SSL exploration needs.
- Document the rationale behind your dataset selection for reference.
