## Overview

This repository contains code for an RL agent implemented in a simple environment using OpenAI Gym. The goal is to demonstrate either Q-learning or a policy gradient method.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym
- [Any other specific libraries or dependencies]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/rl-agent-in-simple-environment.git
    cd rl-agent-in-simple-environment
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Choose the environment:
    - Use an existing OpenAI Gym environment or create a custom environment.
    - Update the environment details in the code as necessary.

2. Implement the RL algorithm:
    - Select either Q-learning or a policy gradient method.
    - Refer to the respective files (`q_learning.py` or `policy_gradient.py`) for the implementation.

3. Run the agent:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
