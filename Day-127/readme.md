# **Day 127: Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA Models**

1. **Understanding ARIMA Model**
   - **Introduction to ARIMA Model:** Begin the day with a comprehensive overview of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.
   - **Components of ARIMA:** Dive into the three main components of ARIMA - Autoregression (AR), Differencing (I), and Moving Average (MA). Understand how each component contributes to modeling time series data.
   - **Mathematical Formulation:** Explore the mathematical formulation of ARIMA and how it represents the underlying patterns in time series data.

2. **Application of ARIMA Models**
   - **Time Series Forecasting:** Learn how to apply ARIMA models for time series forecasting. Understand the steps involved in building an ARIMA model and making predictions.
   - **Parameter Estimation:** Discuss methods for estimating the parameters of an ARIMA model, including the use of algorithms like the Box-Jenkins method.
   - **Model Evaluation:** Explore techniques for evaluating the performance of ARIMA models, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

3. **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Models**
   - **Introduction to SARIMA:** Transition into the concept of Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models, which extend ARIMA to handle seasonality in time series data.
   - **Seasonal Components:** Understand how SARIMA incorporates seasonal components into the ARIMA framework, allowing for more accurate forecasting of seasonal patterns.
   - **Practical Example:** Work through a practical example of building and fitting a SARIMA model to a dataset with seasonal fluctuations.
