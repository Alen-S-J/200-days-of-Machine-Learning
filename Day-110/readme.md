## Overview

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By applying text preprocessing, word embeddings, and machine learning, the goal is to create an effective model for classifying sentiments in movie reviews.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection:**
  - The project starts with obtaining a dataset of movie reviews with labeled sentiments. Datasets like IMDb Movie Reviews or Rotten Tomatoes can be utilized.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Text data is cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
  - Tokenization is applied to break down the text into individual words.
  - Stemming or lemmatization is performed to reduce words to their base form.

- **Text Vectorization:**
  - Techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorization are used to convert text data into numerical vectors.

- **Word Embeddings:**
  - Pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText are applied to represent words in a continuous vector space.

- **Model Development:**
  - A machine learning or deep learning model for sentiment analysis is chosen (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, or recurrent neural networks).

- **Training the Model:**
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the chosen model is trained using the training data.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Model performance is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Fine-tuning:**
  - Hyperparameter tuning is explored to optimize the model's performance.

- **Inference:**
  - The trained model is deployed to make predictions on new, unseen movie reviews.

- **Visualize Results:**
  - Visualizations are created to showcase the model's predictions and analyze its performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on exploration of NLP concepts, from data preprocessing and text vectorization to advanced word embeddings and model development. Sentiment analysis on movie reviews serves as an engaging application of these techniques, demonstrating the practicality and relevance of natural language processing in real-world scenarios.
