# Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on MNIST - Results Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach on the MNIST dataset. The purpose of this README file is to guide you through the results analysis performed on the SSL model.

## Day 99: Results Analysis

### Data Review

Begin by reviewing the data obtained from the SSL implementation. Check for any anomalies, inconsistencies, or patterns in the results.

```python
# Sample code to review data
import numpy as np

# Assuming y_true and y_pred are numpy arrays
unique_labels = np.unique(y_true)
print("Unique Labels:", unique_labels)
```

### Metric Evaluation

Evaluate the performance metrics used to measure the effectiveness of SSL. This could include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any domain-specific metrics relevant to your task.

```python
# Sample code to evaluate metrics
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 Score:", f1)
```

### Comparison with Baselines

If applicable, compare the results with baseline models or traditional supervised learning approaches. Assess whether SSL has provided any improvements over standard methods.

```python
# Sample code for baseline comparison
baseline_accuracy = 0.85

if accuracy > baseline_accuracy:
    print("SSL has provided improvements over the baseline.")
else:
    print("SSL did not outperform the baseline.")
```

## Day 100: Visualization

### Confusion Matrix

Create visualizations, such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, or precision-recall curves, to gain a better understanding of the model's performance.

```python
# Sample code for confusion matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.imshow(conf_matrix, interpolation='nearest', cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.colorbar()
plt.xticks(unique_labels, unique_labels)
plt.yticks(unique_labels, unique_labels)
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.show()
```

### ROC Curve

```python
# Sample code for ROC curve
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2)
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('ROC Curve')
plt.show()
```

### Precision-Recall Curve

```python
# Sample code for precision-recall curve
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(recall, precision, color='green', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.show()
```
