## Overview

This project explores the key components of the Transformer architecture, a revolutionary model in natural language processing and sequential data processing.

## Key Components

### 1. Encoder

The encoder processes the input sequence through:

   - **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Weighs different words based on their relevance to each other.
   
   - **Feedforward Neural Network:** Produces final representations from the self-attention layer.

### 2. Decoder

The decoder generates the output sequence and includes:

   - **Masked Self-Attention Mechanism:** Allows the decoder to focus on past positions during training.
   
   - **Encoder-Decoder Attention Mechanism:** Helps the decoder consider relevant parts of the input sequence.

### 3. Self-Attention Layers

Crucial for both encoder and decoder, self-attention layers capture dependencies between tokens in a sequence.

## How Components Work Together

1. **Encoder:** Processes input, capturing features through self-attention and feedforward layers.
2. **Decoder:** Generates output, considering relationships within the input sequence through masked self-attention and encoder-decoder attention.
3. **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Captures contextual information and dependencies.
