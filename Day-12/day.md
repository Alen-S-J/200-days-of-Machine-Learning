### **Day 12: Exploring Decision Trees**

- **Morning**:
    - **Introduction to Decision Trees**:
        - Understand the basic concept and structure of decision trees.
        - Learn about the entropy and information gain used in decision tree splitting.
- **Afternoon**:
    - **Mathematical Foundation**:
        - Delve into the mathematics behind decision tree algorithms, including entropy calculations and tree splitting criteria.
- **Evening**:
    - **Implementation**:
        - Implement a decision tree algorithm, either a simple one or using a library like scikit-learn.
        - Train the model and visualize the resulting decision tree.
