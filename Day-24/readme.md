### **Day 24: Fine-tuning Clustering Algorithms**

- Learn about the impact of different parameters on clustering algorithms, e.g., the number of clusters in K-means or the linkage method in hierarchical clustering.
- Perform parameter tuning and sensitivity analysis to understand how these choices affect cluster formation.
- Evaluate the quality of clusters using metrics like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or others relevant to your data.
