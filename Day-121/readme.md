**Day 121: Introduction to Time Series Data**

*Morning Session: Basics of Time Series Data*

1. **Research and Introductory Materials:**
   - Time series data is a sequence of observations recorded over time. These observations could be in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or other intervals.
   - It is used to understand past behavior, predict future trends, and make informed decisions.
   - Read about how time series data differs from cross-sectional data, where observations are taken at a single point in time.

2. **Fundamental Concept: Sequences Ordered by Time:**
   - Time series data is characterized by its temporal ordering, where each data point is associated with a specific timestamp.
   - Understand how this temporal ordering distinguishes time series data from other types of datasets.
   - Recognize that the analysis of time series data involves understanding patterns and trends over time.

3. **Identifying Examples:**
   - Explore examples of time series data in various fields:
     - In finance: Stock prices over time.
     - In climate science: Temperature measurements over months or years.
     - In linguistics: Word frequency over time.
   - Recognize that time series data is prevalent across different domains.

*Afternoon Session: Characteristics of Time Series Data*

1. **Key Characteristics: Trend, Seasonality, and Noise:**
   - **Trend:** A long-term movement in data, indicating a general direction upwards or downwards.
   - **Seasonality:** Repeating patterns or cycles in the data, often corresponding to certain time intervals.
   - **Noise:** Random fluctuations that make it challenging to identify underlying patterns.
   
2. **Influence on Behavior:**
   - **Trend's Influence:** Helps identify overall direction, aiding in long-term predictions.
   - **Seasonality's Influence:** Captures repetitive patterns, crucial for short-term forecasting.
   - **Noise's Influence:** Introduces randomness, making predictions more challenging.

3. **Case Studies and Examples:**
   - Look for case studies or examples illustrating these characteristics:
     - Trend: Analyzing economic data to identify long-term growth or decline.
     - Seasonality: Examining retail sales to identify patterns during holiday seasons.
     - Noise: Recognizing unexpected fluctuations in a stock's daily price.
