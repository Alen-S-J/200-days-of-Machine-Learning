# **Mathematical Background:**

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to find a new set of orthogonal axes (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized. This is achieved through linear algebra concepts, specifically eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### **Covariance Matrix:**

To perform PCA, you start with a dataset with \(n\) data points and \(m\) features. First, you compute the covariance matrix \(C\), which represents the relationships between features.

\[C = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \mu)(X_i - \mu)^T\]

Where:
- \(X_i\) is a data point.
- \(\mu\) is the mean vector of the data.

### **Eigenvalue Decomposition:**

Next, you find the eigenvalues (\(\lambda\)) and eigenvectors (\(v\)) of the covariance matrix \(C). These eigenvalues and eigenvectors represent the directions and amount of variance in the data.

**Selecting Principal Components:**

Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top \(k\) eigenvectors to form the principal components.

**Transform Data:**

You can then project the original data onto these principal components to obtain a lower-dimensional representation of the data.

**Python Code Example:**

Here's a simple Python code example using NumPy to perform PCA:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                 [4, 5, 6],
                 [7, 8, 9])

# Step 1: Calculate the mean of the data
mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)

# Step 2: Calculate the covariance matrix
cov_matrix = np.cov(data, rowvar=False)

# Step 3: Perform eigenvalue decomposition
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)

# Step 4: Select the top \(k\) eigenvectors (principal components)
k = 2  # For example, select the top 2 components
top_eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, :k]

# Step 5: Transform the data
transformed_data = np.dot(data - mean, top_eigenvectors)

# 'transformed_data' now contains the lower-dimensional representation of the data
