#### Morning:
1. **Setup and Environment Preparation**:
   - Ensure the development environment is set up with the required libraries, frameworks, and GPU support if applicable.
   - Confirm that the dataset is accessible and properly formatted for model training.

2. **SSL Model Implementation**:
   - Begin coding the selected SSL technique (e.g., self-training, semi-supervised GANs, pseudo-labeling) using the chosen framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).
   - Set up the architecture and components of the SSL model, including the labeled and unlabeled data handling mechanisms.

#### Afternoon:
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - If necessary, preprocess the dataset to fit the SSL model's input requirements.
   - Prepare data augmentation techniques or other preprocessing steps for better model generalization.

4. **Initial Model Training**:
   - Initiate training on a smaller subset of the data or a preliminary version of the SSL model to ensure code functionality.
   - Debug and address any issues in the implementation.

#### Evening:
5. **Documentation and Logging**:
   - Document the implementation steps, changes made, and decisions taken during the coding process.
   - Set up logging mechanisms to track model performance, hyperparameters, and experiment details for later analysis.
