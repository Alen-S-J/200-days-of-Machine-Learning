## Introduction
Text cleaning and normalization are essential steps in natural language processing (NLP) to prepare text data for analysis. This script showcases common techniques, such as lowercasing, removing special characters, handling stop words, and stemming.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Usage
To use the script, simply call the `clean_and_normalize_text` function with your text input. The function will return the cleaned and normalized text.

```python
cleaned_text = clean_and_normalize_text("Your input text here.")
print("Cleaned and Normalized Text:")
print(cleaned_text)
```

## Functionality
1. **Lowercasing:** Converts all characters to lowercase for uniformity.
2. **Handling Special Characters:** Removes non-alphabetic characters, numbers, and punctuation.
3. **Tokenization:** Splits the text into words using NLTK's word_tokenize.
4. **Stop Words Removal:** Eliminates common English stop words.
5. **Stemming:** Reduces words to their base form using Porter Stemmer.

## Example
```python
sample_text = "Cleaning and Normalization is an important step in text processing. It involves removing special characters, numbers, and handling stop words."
cleaned_text = clean_and_normalize_text(sample_text)
print("Original Text:")
print(sample_text)
print("\nCleaned and Normalized Text:")
print(cleaned_text)
```
