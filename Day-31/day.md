## Neural Networks in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

A **neural network**, in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It's a type of algorithm that attempts to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. Neural networks consist of interconnected processing units, or artificial neurons, which work together to process and transform data.

### Key Characteristics of Neural Networks

1. **Artificial Neurons:** These are the fundamental units of a neural network, inspired by the biological neurons in the human brain. Each artificial neuron processes input data and produces an output.

2. **Layers:** Neural networks are typically organized into layers, including:
   - Input Layer
   - One or more Hidden Layers
   - Output Layer
   Each layer contains multiple neurons.

3. **Connections:** Neurons in one layer are connected to neurons in the adjacent layer through weighted connections. These weights determine the strength of the connections and are adjusted during the learning process.

4. **Activation Function:** Each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs. Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing neural networks to model complex relationships in data.

5. **Learning:** Neural networks are capable of learning from data. They are trained using a process called backpropagation, where errors are minimized by adjusting the connection weights.

6. **Applications:** Neural networks are used in a wide range of applications, including:
   - Image and Speech Recognition
   - Natural Language Processing
   - Autonomous Vehicles
   - Recommendation Systems
   and more.

Neural networks are known for their ability to handle complex and high-dimensional data, making them valuable tools in various machine learning and AI tasks. Different neural network architectures and variations have been developed over the years to address specific problems, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
