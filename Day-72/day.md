Absolutely! Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are foundational to understanding sequential decision-making in Reinforcement Learning. Here are the theoretical concepts and corresponding mathematical expressions in Markdown format:

### Theoretical Concepts in MDPs

#### 1. **States (𝑆), Actions (𝐴), and Transitions (𝑃)**
- **Definition:** 
  - **States (𝑆)**: Represent different situations an agent can be in.
  - **Actions (𝐴)**: Choices available to the agent in each state.
  - **Transitions (𝑃)**: Probability of transitioning from one state to another given an action.
- **Mathematical Expressions:**
  - **State Space (𝑆)**: Set of all possible states.

  - **Action Space (𝐴)**: Set of all possible actions.

  - **Transition Function (𝑃)**: Probability of transitioning from state 𝑠 to state 𝑠' by taking action 𝑎.
    - ![Transition Function](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?P_{ss'}^a=\mathbb{P}(S_{t+1}=s'|S_t=s,A_t=a))

#### 2. **Rewards (𝑅) and Return (𝐺)**
- **Definition:** 
  - **Rewards (𝑅)**: Immediate numerical values received by the agent upon taking actions.
  - **Return (𝐺)**: Total accumulated rewards obtained from a specific state-action sequence.
- **Mathematical Expressions:**
  - **Reward Function (𝑅)**: Immediate reward obtained when transitioning from state 𝑠 to state 𝑠' by taking action 𝑎.
    - ![Reward Function](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R_{s}^{a}=\mathbb{E}[R_{t+1}|S_t=s,A_t=a,S_{t+1}=s'])
  - **Return (𝐺)**: Total discounted sum of rewards from time step 𝑡.
    - ![Return](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?G_t=R_{t+1}+\gamma&space;R_{t+2}+\gamma^2R_{t+3}+...)

#### 3. **Markov Property and Bellman Equation**
- **Definition:** 
  - **Markov Property**: The future is conditionally independent of the past given the present state.
  - **Bellman Equation**: Recursive relationship between the value of a state and the values of its successor states.
- **Mathematical Expressions:**
  - **Markov Property**:
    - ![Markov Property](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathbb{P}(S_{t+1}|S_t)=\mathbb{P}(S_{t+1}|S_1,S_2,...,S_t))
  - **Bellman Expectation Equation for State Values (𝑉)**:
    - ![Bellman Equation for State Values](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V^{\pi}(s)=\sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s',r}p(s',r|s,a)[r+\gamma&space;V^{\pi}(s')])

Understanding these concepts lays the groundwork for solving MDPs and forms the basis for developing algorithms like value iteration and policy iteration in Reinforcement Learning.
