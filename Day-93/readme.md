### Computer Vision:
SSL in computer vision leverages techniques like **contrastive learning** or **pretext tasks** to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. Models are trained to predict relationships between different parts of an image or to solve pretext tasks, which indirectly helps in improving performance on downstream tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation with limited labeled data. SSL enables models to capture robust features, reducing the dependency on large labeled datasets.

#### Techniques:
- **Contrastive Learning**: Trains a neural network to bring similar representations of similar data points closer and dissimilar ones apart.
- **Pretext Tasks**: Examples include predicting image rotations, solving jigsaw puzzles, or image colorization without explicit supervision.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
In NLP, SSL techniques aim to learn meaningful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled text data. Similar to computer vision, SSL methods like **masked language modeling** or **autoencoding** help capture contextual information from text. These learned representations can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or language modeling with limited labeled data, improving overall performance.

#### Techniques:
- **Masked Language Modeling**: Predicting masked words within a sentence, as seen in models like BERT.
- **Autoencoding**: Encoding the input text into a latent representation and then decoding it back to the original input, as seen in models like GPT.

### Speech Recognition:
SSL in speech recognition focuses on leveraging unlabeled speech data to improve model performance. Techniques like **contrastive predictive coding** or **time-contrastive networks** aim to learn representations from unlabeled speech data. These learned representations help in training more robust speech recognition models with limited labeled data.

#### Techniques:
- **Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)**: Learns representations by predicting future speech segments from past ones without requiring explicit labels.
- **Time-Contrastive Networks (TCN)**: Learns discriminative representations by contrasting different segments of speech data.

### Comparison and Summary:
- **Similarities**: SSL techniques in all domains aim to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data to improve performance on downstream tasks with limited labeled data.
- **Differences**: While the techniques might vary, the core idea remains consistent: leveraging unlabeled data to improve model representations.
- **Effectiveness**: SSL has shown promising results across these domains, reducing the dependency on large labeled datasets and enabling models to generalize better to new data.

For code implementations, various libraries and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers provide pre-implemented SSL techniques for each domain. Implementations might vary based on the specific task and the model architecture chosen.
