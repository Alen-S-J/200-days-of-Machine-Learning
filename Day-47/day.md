# Day 47: CIFAR-10 CNN Experiment: Optimization and Interpretation

## 1. Setting up Environment
- Install TensorFlow and necessary libraries.
- Set up a virtual environment for development.

## 2. Dataset Selection
- Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## 3. Building CNN
- Define a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Experiment with different layers and hyperparameters.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Experiment with various learning rates: 0.001, 0.01, 0.1.
- Adjust batch sizes: 32, 64, 128.
- Add regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay).

## 5. Data Augmentation
- Implement image augmentation techniques.
- Normalize the data for efficient training.

## 6. Training and Evaluation
- Compile and train the CNN model on the dataset.
- Evaluate model performance on the test set.

## 7. Performance Evaluation
- Calculate evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score).
- Generate confusion matrix for analysis.

## 8. Visualization and Interpretability
- Visualize learned filters from the Conv2D layers.
- Explore Grad-CAM for understanding influential image parts.

## 9. Optimization and Efficiency
- Experiment with model compression techniques (e.g., pruning).
- Optimize the model for faster inference on various hardware.


## 10. Sample Prediction
```python
# Sample prediction code snippet (as previously provided)
# ... (code for a sample prediction)
```

## 11.Documentation and Reporting
- Create a summary report outlining key findings and insights.
- Add comments and documentation to the code for reproducibility.
