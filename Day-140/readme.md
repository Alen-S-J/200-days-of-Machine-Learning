# **Day 140 of 200 Days of ML**



**Morning:**

1. **Summarize Learnings from Days 137-139:**
   - Reflect on the key concepts, techniques, and skills acquired during the past three days.
   - Note any challenges encountered and how they were addressed.
   - Consider how these learnings contribute to your overall understanding and proficiency in machine learning.

2. **Choose a Specific Project:**
   - Based on your interests and skills, select a project that aligns with your learning objectives.
   - Consider projects that allow you to apply the knowledge gained from Days 137-139 effectively.

3. **Define Project Goals and Outline a Technical Roadmap:**
   - Clearly define the objectives you aim to achieve with your project.
   - Break down the project into smaller tasks and outline a step-by-step roadmap for its execution.
   - Identify the technologies, tools, and methodologies you will utilize to accomplish each task.

**Afternoon:**

4. **Start Gathering Necessary Data:**
   - Identify and collect relevant datasets for your chosen project.
   - Explore online repositories, datasets provided by organizations, or consider generating synthetic data if necessary.
   - Ensure the data you gather aligns with the goals of your project and is suitable for analysis and modeling.

5. **Preprocess and Explore the Data:**
   - Cleanse and preprocess the gathered data to address any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data's characteristics, distributions, and relationships.
   - Visualize key aspects of the data to aid in understanding and decision-making.

6. **Select or Modify Existing Models:**
   - Evaluate existing machine learning models that are relevant to your project.
   - Determine if any modifications or customizations are required to adapt these models to your specific requirements.
   - Consider the scalability, performance, and interpretability of the models in relation to your project goals.

**Evening:**

7. **Refine Your Project Plan:**
   - Review and refine your project plan based on insights gained from data exploration and model selection.
   - Adjust timelines, tasks, or priorities as needed to ensure the project remains on track.
   - Consider potential risks or challenges and develop strategies to mitigate them.

8. **Discuss Your Project Idea with Online Communities:**
   - Engage with online communities, forums, or social media platforms related to machine learning.
   - Share your project idea and seek feedback, suggestions, or insights from other practitioners and enthusiasts.
   - Incorporate valuable feedback into your project plan to enhance its quality and effectiveness.
