### Experimentation with GAN Hyperparameters

#### Theory:

**Learning Rate:**
- Learning rate controls the step size during optimization in a GAN.
- Higher learning rates may lead to faster convergence initially, but they might overshoot the optimal point or cause instability in training due to large steps.
- Smaller learning rates can result in slower convergence but might help the model reach a more precise optimum. They are often more stable during training.

**Batch Size:**
- Batch size determines the number of samples processed before the model's parameters are updated during training.
- Larger batch sizes provide a more accurate estimate of the gradient direction as they capture a better representation of the dataset's statistics.
- However, larger batches might lead to longer training times per epoch and require more memory. Smaller batches can converge faster per epoch but might have more variance in gradient estimates.

**Layer Sizes:**
- The architecture of the generator and discriminator plays a crucial role in a GAN's performance.
- Larger networks with more layers and neurons might capture more complex features from the data.
- However, larger architectures can also increase training time significantly and might be prone to overfitting, especially with limited data.
- Smaller networks might be computationally more efficient but may struggle to learn complex patterns and might not generalize well.
