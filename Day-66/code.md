# Hands on the Implementation

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to have pixel values in the range [-1, 1].
   
2. **Generator and Discriminator Models:**
   - The generator and discriminator models are defined using sequential layers in Keras.
   - LeakyReLU activation functions are used for non-linearity in hidden layers.
   - The discriminator is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
   
3. **Combined GAN Model:**
   - The GAN model is formed by connecting the generator and discriminator.
   - The discriminator is frozen during the training of the combined GAN model.
   - The GAN model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
   
4. **Training Loop:**
   - The training loop runs for a specified number of epochs.
   - Random batches of real images from the MNIST dataset and fake images generated by the generator are used.
   - Discriminator and generator are trained alternatively.
   - Discriminator aims to distinguish between real and fake images while the generator tries to fool the discriminator.
   - The progress, discriminator loss, and generator loss are printed periodically.
   - Generated images are displayed and saved at certain intervals for visualization.
