# **Generative Models and Pix2Pix Implementation**



### Introduction

This repository contains materials and code related to the exploration of generative models, focusing on Pix2Pix implementation for image-to-image translation tasks. Throughout this project, we delve into the theoretical foundations of generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and practically implement Pix2Pix for various applications.

### Contents

1. **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks covering the theoretical concepts of generative models and hands-on implementation of Pix2Pix using popular deep learning frameworks.

2. **Datasets**: Here, you can find datasets used for training and testing Pix2Pix models. These datasets include images for tasks like image colorization, style transfer, and super-resolution.

3. **Code**: This directory holds the Python scripts and helper functions for implementing Pix2Pix models. It includes training scripts, evaluation scripts, and utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization.

4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on the project setup, requirements, and usage instructions can be found here. It includes guidelines on running the code, training models, and experimenting with different datasets and hyperparameters.

5. **Resources**: Supplementary resources such as research papers, articles, and tutorials on generative models and Pix2Pix are available in this directory. These resources serve as additional reading materials for further understanding the concepts discussed.

6. **Results**: After training Pix2Pix models, the results including generated images and evaluation metrics are stored in this directory for analysis and comparison.
