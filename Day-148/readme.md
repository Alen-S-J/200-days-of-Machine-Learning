# Pix2Pix

Pix2Pix is a popular generative model for image-to-image translation tasks. It utilizes a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to learn the mapping between input and output images in a supervised manner. This README provides an overview of Pix2Pix, installation instructions, and a usage guide.

## Overview

Pix2Pix consists of two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to transform input images from one domain to another, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between the generated images and real images from the target domain. By training these two networks simultaneously in an adversarial manner, Pix2Pix can produce high-quality, realistic output images that closely resemble the target domain.

## Installation

To use Pix2Pix, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Training

To train a Pix2Pix model, you'll need a dataset containing paired images from the input and output domains. Follow these steps to train the model:

1. Prepare your dataset: Organize your paired images into two directories: one for input images and one for corresponding output images.
2. Define the architecture: Choose the architecture for the generator and discriminator. You can use the provided implementations or customize them as needed.
3. Compile the models: Compile the generator and discriminator models separately, specifying the loss functions and optimizers.
4. Train the GAN: Train the generator and discriminator simultaneously using the paired images from your dataset.

### Inference

Once trained, you can use the trained generator to perform image-to-image translation on new input images. Follow these steps to perform inference:

1. Load the trained generator model.
2. Preprocess the input image: Resize and normalize the input image as required by the generator.
3. Generate the output image: Feed the preprocessed input image to the generator to generate the corresponding output image.
4. Postprocess the output image: Denormalize and visualize the generated output image.
