# Pix2Pix Image Translation

This repository contains code for implementing and experimenting with Pix2Pix, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture used for image-to-image translation tasks. In this project, we explore various applications of Pix2Pix, such as image colorization, style transfer, and super-resolution, and provide implementations using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Introduction

Generative models like Pix2Pix have gained significant popularity for their ability to generate high-quality and realistic images from input data. Pix2Pix uses a conditional GAN approach, where the generator learns to translate input images from one domain to another, guided by conditional information. This project aims to delve into Pix2Pix's architecture, applications, and implementation details through practical experimentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:


1. Install the required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

2. Download the datasets for your chosen image-to-image translation task (e.g., Facades, Cityscapes).

## Implementation Details

This repository includes implementations of Pix2Pix models using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is organized into separate directories for each implementation, with detailed comments and documentation to aid understanding. Key components such as the generator, discriminator, and training loop are implemented following best practices and research guidelines.

## Usage

To train and evaluate a Pix2Pix model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and preprocess the images as required.

2. Choose the implementation (TensorFlow or PyTorch) based on your preference and environment setup.

3. Configure the hyperparameters and model settings in the provided configuration files or scripts.

4. Run the training script to train the Pix2Pix model on your dataset.

5. Evaluate the trained model using test images and metrics to assess its performance.

## Results

We provide sample results and visualizations of Pix2Pix models trained on different tasks and datasets. These results showcase the model's ability to perform image translation tasks effectively, demonstrating colorization, style transfer, and super-resolution capabilities.
