# Transformer Architecture Readme

## Overview

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of the Transformer architecture, a revolutionary model introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper "Attention is All You Need." The Transformer architecture has played a pivotal role in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing a highly parallelizable and efficient way of capturing contextual relationships in sequential data.

## Key Concepts

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The core innovation of the Transformer architecture lies in its self-attention mechanism. Unlike traditional sequence-to-sequence models, where each output element depends on the entire input sequence, self-attention allows the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence differently when generating each output element. This mechanism enables capturing long-range dependencies in a more efficient manner.

### Multi-Head Attention

To enhance the model's ability to capture diverse patterns, the Transformer employs multi-head attention. This involves using multiple sets of attention weights (attention heads) in parallel. Each attention head learns different aspects of the relationships between words, providing the model with a richer understanding of the input sequence.

### Positional Encoding

Since the Transformer architecture lacks inherent sequential information, positional encoding is introduced to convey the order of elements in the input sequence. This encoding is added to the input embeddings, allowing the model to differentiate between the positions of different tokens.
