# Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on MNIST

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques on the MNIST dataset. The focus is on utilizing SSL, specifically SimCLR, to achieve image classification without the need for extensive labeled data.

## Results Analysis

### Accuracy Calculation

```python
# Code snippet for calculating accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(ground_truth_labels, predicted_labels)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Classification Report

```python
# Code snippet for generating a detailed classification report
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

classification_rep = classification_report(ground_truth_labels, predicted_labels)
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_rep)
```

## Documentation

### SSL Technique Used

For SSL, we employed a contrastive learning approach using SimCLR. The model was trained on a self-generated dataset from the MNIST images, where positive pairs were augmented versions of the same image, and negative pairs were random images from the dataset.

**Model Architecture:**
- Encoder: ResNet-based architecture
- Loss Function: Contrastive loss with temperature scaling

**Pre-processing Steps:**
- Standardization and normalization of pixel values
- Augmentation techniques: random rotations, flips, and changes in brightness

### Insights into Advantages and Drawbacks

**Advantages:**
- SSL eliminated the need for labeled data, making it a cost-effective solution.
- The model demonstrated robust performance on MNIST, even with limited labeled data.

**Drawbacks:**
- Sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, especially temperature scaling.
- Limited interpretability compared to traditional supervised models.

## Conclusion and Future Steps

### Conclusion

In conclusion, our SSL implementation using SimCLR on the MNIST dataset achieved commendable accuracy without the need for extensive labeled data. However, careful consideration is required for hyperparameter tuning. The approach showed promise for self-supervised learning on image classification tasks.

### Potential Improvements and Modifications

1. Fine-tuning the model on a smaller set of labeled data to improve performance.
2. Experimenting with different SSL techniques or architectures.
3. Investigating the impact of additional augmentations on SSL performance.

### Future Directions

1. Extending the approach to more complex datasets beyond MNIST.
2. Exploring SSL in combination with semi-supervised learning techniques.
3. Researching SSL applications in other domains, such as natural language processing.
