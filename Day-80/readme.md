# Day 80: Experimentation and Tuning

- **Goal:** 
    Today's objective is to delve into the process of optimizing our learning agent's performance by experimenting with various parameters and neural network architectures.

- **Activities:**
    - *Hyperparameter Exploration:* Begin by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rates, discount factors, exploration rates, or batch sizes. Document these changes meticulously.
    - *Reward Structure Variations:* Experiment with different reward structures to gauge their impact on the agent's learning process. Assess the agent's behavior and learning outcomes in response to varied rewards.
    - *Neural Network Architecture Modifications:* Explore alterations in the neural network architecture. This might involve changing layer sizes, adding/removing layers, or utilizing different activation functions.
    - *Performance Analysis:* Carefully observe and record the effects of these alterations on the agent's learning progress. Analyze the results to understand which changes positively or negatively affect its learning curve.

- **Results and Insights:**
    - Document the observed impact of each experiment on the agent's learning performance.
    - Analyze patterns or trends in how specific changes influence the learning process.
    - Note down any surprising findings or unexpected behaviors observed during these experiments.

- **Next Steps:**
    - Based on the insights gained, prioritize further experiments or adjustments that show promise in enhancing the agent's learning capabilities.
    - Consider iterating on successful alterations or combining different approaches to achieve optimal results.

- **Challenges Faced:**
    - Record any challenges encountered during the experimentation process, including unexpected behaviors or difficulties in interpreting results. This will help in refining future experimentation strategies.

- **Reflection:**
    - Reflect on the overall impact of today's experiments on the agent's learning journey. Consider how these findings contribute to the broader objective of optimizing its performance.
