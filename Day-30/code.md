# Visualizing Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

This Python code demonstrates how to visualize dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It's part of a "200 Days of ML" challenge, where we explore the impact of PCA on data visualization, feature selection, data compression, and noise reduction.

## Code Overview

1. Load the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, a common choice for binary classification tasks.
2. Apply PCA to reduce the data to two principal components.
3. Create scatter plots to visualize the original data and the reduced dimensions.
4. The first plot displays the original data, highlighting two selected features.
5. The second plot shows the data reduced to two principal components using PCA.

## Key Takeaways

- PCA is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in machine learning.
- It helps in feature selection, data compression, and noise reduction.
- The code showcases how to visualize the effects of PCA on a real dataset.

Feel free to adapt and use this code to explore the impact of PCA on other datasets and tasks in your machine learning journey.
