### **Day 14: Model Evaluation and Metrics**

- **Morning**:
    - **Introduction to Model Evaluation**:
        - Learn about the importance of model evaluation and validation.
        - Understand different evaluation techniques like train-test split, cross-validation, and holdout validation.
- **Afternoon**:
    - **Common Metrics for Classification**:
        - Understand common metrics for classification models: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and AUC-ROC.
- **Evening**:
    - **Implementation and Evaluation**:
        - Implement evaluation procedures using the concepts learned earlier.
        - Evaluate the previously implemented classification algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, KNN) using appropriate metrics.
