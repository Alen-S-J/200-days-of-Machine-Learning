# Project Selection based on the Challenge

## **Project Title:** Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

**Scope and Objectives:**
The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can automatically classify the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of product reviews. The model will be trained on a dataset of product reviews from various sources to help businesses understand customer feedback and sentiments towards their products.

**Research Potential ML/DL Problems:**
- Sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP): Explore NLP techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification.
- Classification algorithms: Research machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for sentiment analysis tasks.
- Sentiment lexicons and word embeddings: Investigate the use of sentiment lexicons (e.g., SentiWordNet) and word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy.

**Identify Datasets:**
- Use publicly available datasets such as Amazon Product Reviews, Yelp Reviews, or Twitter Sentiment140 dataset for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
- Preprocess the dataset by cleaning text, removing stop words, and tokenizing reviews to prepare it for machine learning or deep learning algorithms.

**Project Plan:**
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Acquire the chosen dataset(s) and perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Experiment with different machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment analysis, considering algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, RNNs, LSTM, or BERT.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.
3. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters, perform cross-validation, and handle overfitting/underfitting issues.
4. **Deployment and Integration**:
   - Deploy the trained sentiment analysis model as an API or web service for real-time sentiment classification of product reviews.
   - Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface or dashboard for businesses to analyze customer sentiment.

**Timeline and Milestones:**
- Week 1: Project planning, dataset acquisition, and initial data preprocessing.
- Week 2: Model development, training, and evaluation.
- Week 3: Hyperparameter tuning, optimization, and model deployment.
- Week 4: Integration, testing, documentation, and project presentation.
