Matrix Multiplication Result:
 [[19 22]
 [43 50]]
Explanation:
Matrix multiplication is performed using the dot product of the elements from the rows of matrix A and the columns of matrix B. For example, C[0,0] = (1*5) + (2*7) = 19.

------------------
Dot Product of v1 and v2: 32
Explanation:
The dot product of vectors v1 and v2 is obtained by summing the product of corresponding elements of the vectors: v1[0]*v2[0] + v1[1]*v2[1] + v1[2]*v2[2] = 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32.

--------------------
Solution to the system of linear equations: [3. 1.]
Explanation:
The linear system is solved using NumPy's linalg.solve function, providing the solutions for x and y that satisfy the given equations 2x + 3y = 8 and 4x - 5y = -1.

--------------------
Eigenvalues: [3. 2.]
Eigenvectors:
 [[ 0.89 -0.71]
 [ 0.45  0.71]]
Explanation:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A are computed. Eigenvalues represent the scaling factors in the respective eigenvector directions, indicating the behavior of the matrix under transformation.

Singular Value Decomposition:
U:
 [[-0.23 -0.79]
 [-0.53 -0.35]
 [-0.82  0.43]]
S:
 [9.53 0.93]
VT:
 [[-0.6  -0.8]
 [ 0.8  -0.6]]
Explanation:
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) decomposes the matrix A into three separate matrices: U, S, and VT. U and VT contain the left and right singular vectors respectively, while S contains the singular values. This decomposition is widely used in various machine learning applications like dimensionality reduction and collaborative filtering.
