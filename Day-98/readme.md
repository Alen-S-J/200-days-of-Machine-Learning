### Day 98: Experimentation and Model Refinement


1. **Hyperparameter Exploration**:
   - Conduct experiments by tweaking hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, regularization techniques, etc.).
   - Run multiple training sessions with varying hyperparameters to understand their impact on model performance.

2. **Architecture Modifications or Variations**:
   - Experiment with different architectures or variations of the SSL model (if applicable) to assess their effectiveness.
   - Test additional SSL approaches or loss functions to compare their performance against the baseline.


3. **Comprehensive Training**:
   - Based on the findings from the morning experiments, select promising configurations and perform more extensive training.
   - Monitor and log the performance metrics at regular intervals during training.

4. **Evaluation and Analysis**:
   - Evaluate the trained models on validation or held-out datasets to assess their generalization capabilities.
   - Analyze the experiment results, comparing performance metrics, convergence rates, and potential overfitting.


5. **Model Refinement and Conclusion**:
   - Fine-tune the model based on the insights gained from experiments and analyses.
   - Summarize the findings, noting the most effective hyperparameters, architectures, or SSL approaches for the given dataset and task.
