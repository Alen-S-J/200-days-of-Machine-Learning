# PCA for Breast Cancer Dataset

## Introduction
In this code, we implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Breast Cancer dataset using Python. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps us uncover the most significant patterns in high-dimensional data.

## Code Explanation
1. We start by importing the necessary libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and the Breast Cancer dataset.

2. We load the Breast Cancer dataset, which contains features representing tumor characteristics and labels indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

3. To ensure that features have similar scales, we standardize the data using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.

4. We specify the number of principal components we want to keep, in this case, 2, and perform PCA using `PCA` from scikit-learn.

5. We calculate and print the explained variance ratio, which indicates how much of the data's variance is retained by the selected components.

6. Finally, we create a scatter plot to visualize the data in the reduced two-dimensional space. Each point represents a tumor sample, and the colors represent whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Results
By reducing the dimensionality of the data from its original high dimension to 2 dimensions, we can visualize the Breast Cancer dataset in a more manageable form. The scatter plot shows the distribution of tumor samples in the reduced feature space, making it easier to spot patterns and relationships between the data points.

## Conclusion
PCA is a valuable technique for dimensionality reduction and visualization, especially when working with high-dimensional datasets like the Breast Cancer dataset. It allows us to maintain essential information while simplifying the data for further analysis and interpretation.
