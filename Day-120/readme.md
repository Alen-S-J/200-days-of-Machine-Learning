# Extract Stock Sentiment From News Headlines

## Project Overview

In the fast-paced world of financial markets, staying informed about the sentiment surrounding stocks is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The "Extract Stock Sentiment From News Headlines" project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze financial news headlines, specifically focusing on stocks such as Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA). By applying sentiment analysis to these headlines, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into market sentiments, helping investors gauge the overall perception of a stock.

## How it Works

   - Ensure proper handling of web scraping, considering ethical and legal aspects.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Utilizes NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted headlines.
   - The sentiment analysis helps in understanding the emotional tone of the news, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

3. **Investment Insight:**
   - Based on the sentiment analysis results, the project generates investment insights.
   - The goal is to predict whether the market sentiment is positive or negative about a particular stock.

4. **Real-time Updates:**
   - The system is designed to provide real-time updates, reflecting the most recent news and sentiment analysis results.
   - Users can stay informed about the changing sentiment landscape for the selected stocks.
