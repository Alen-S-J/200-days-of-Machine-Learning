- **Morning Session**:
  1. Choose an appropriate image segmentation architecture based on your project requirements and dataset characteristics. Popular choices include U-Net, DeepLab, Mask R-CNN, etc.
  2. Set up your development environment by installing the necessary libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  3. Download or prepare your dataset for training. Ensure that it includes both input images and corresponding segmentation masks.

- **Afternoon Session**:
  4. Implement the chosen image segmentation model architecture using the selected deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch).
  5. Define the necessary data preprocessing steps, including data augmentation techniques if required.
  6. Split your dataset into training, validation, and possibly test sets.
  7. Train the segmentation model on the training dataset. Monitor the training process for convergence and adjust hyperparameters if necessary.
  8. Validate the trained model on the validation set to assess its performance and adjust the model architecture or training process as needed.
