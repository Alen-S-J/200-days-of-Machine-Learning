### Day 46: Dataset Selection and CNN Building

#### Dataset Selection
- Choose an image dataset suitable for classification tasks:
  - MNIST for basic digit classification.
  - ImageNet for a large-scale dataset with diverse categories.
- Download the dataset and preprocess if necessary (e.g., normalization, resizing).

#### Building CNN Architecture
- Implement a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the chosen framework.
- Design the architecture with:
  - Convolutional layers
  - Pooling layers
  - Fully connected layers
- Compile the model with an appropriate:
  - Optimizer
  - Loss function
